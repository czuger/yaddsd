It also has an amazingly sensitive sense of touch: it has Perception 14 (+2) and has advantage on all Perception checks, allowing it to detect minute cracks and openings. You can choose to use your action to treat the hands as a sensor and feel through them. 
        Pugnacious Pugilist. The hands are clenched and covered with bandages, as if they belong to a boxer. They attack using your spell attack modifier. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage.

        Silencing Hand. The hands fly towards a target you choose within range that you can see and clamp themselves tightly over the creature’s mouth, using your spell attack modifier to grapple the creature. While grappling a creature, the hands cannot be pulled away. The hands take only half the damage dealt to them and the creature grappled by the hands take the other half. While grappled, the creature is incapable of speaking and is at a disadvantage to all ranged attacks.
        Strangling Grip. The hands fly towards a Small- or Medium-sized target you choose within range that you can see and grab onto its throat, using your spell attack modifier to attack. On a hit, it does 2d4 bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled (escape DC is your Spell Save DC). Until this grapple ends, the target can’t breathe.

A successful Dexterity saving throw will halve the damage they take from this.
        The chariot can move on the ground with a speed of 50, or fly with a speed of 100. You control the chariot through verbal commands.

        While in the corpse, you may move and act through it, and you can use your class abilities normally. You retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma but you have the Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity of the host’s, as well as its original hit points. You use the corpse’s senses as your own. Your own body is paralyzed and does not need to eat or drink, and must remain within 5 miles of your host body. However, you are still linked to your body, and you may use your action to transfer your senses to your original body.
        If your host body drops to 0 hit points for whatever reason, or the link between your host body and your real body is abruptly severed (such as by a dispel magic or antimagic field), you must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the shock of the destruction of the link was too great your own body immediately drops to 0 hit points as well. You may choose to end the link between the two at any time and return to your own body without harm.

        You place a circlet on your head or the head of an ally and the circlet begins to glow. The circlet takes one of three forms:
        ♦        Crown of Brilliance. Your circlet glows with blazing golden light. If in battle, your opponents in melee combat must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. Even if the save is successful, the opponent will be at disadvantage to attack you due to the brilliant light emanating from you.
        Creatures that have the trait Sunlight Sensitivity or Sunlight Hypersensitivity must make an additional Constitution saving throw, at disadvantage if they failed the first one. If they fail, they are also frightened of you for 1 minute.
        Finally, undead and fiends take 2d6 radiant damage each time they end their turn within 10 feet of you.
        ♦        Crown of Flames. Your circlet erupts with holy fire. All aberrations, fey, fiends, and undead with evil alignment within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 fire damage and 4d8 radiant damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one.
        ♦        Crown of Glory. Your circlet glows with beautiful rainbow light, inspiring awe in lesser creatures. All creatures with 50 or fewer hit points that are within 30 feet of you are automatically incapacitated for 1 minute. Creatures with 50-100 hit points may make a Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitate for 1 minute. Creatures with more than 100 hit points are immune.
        Furthermore, when you speak, your words form a suggestion, as per the spell. All creatures who are within 30 feet of you who are incapacitated must make a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for up to 8 hours and will follow your suggestion to the best of its ability, provided that the suggestion is reasonable and non-dangerous.


Crystalbrittle

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
        You touch a metal object of , whether as soft as gold or as hard as adamantite, to become permanently as fragile as glass. You can affect up to 1,000 pounds of metal. If the object is being held or worn by a creature, that creature may make a Charisma saving throw to negate this spell. If the item is magical, the creature has advantage on that roll. The effects of this spell cannot be reversed by anything short of a wish.


Curse of Lycanthropy
6th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a drop of blood from a true lycanthrope)
Duration: Instantaneous
        You touch a humanoid and turn it into an infected lycanthrope. The target may make a Constitution saving throw to avoid this spell. The exact species of lycanthrope depends on the nature and temperament of your target.
        If your target fails its saving throw, then on the next full moon, it will transform each night of the three nights of the full moon. On the day after the third night, the subject may make another saving throw, with disadvantage unless the target failed to kill anything during those three nights.
        This spell continues until the target succeeds at three saving throws, although these saves do not need to be consecutive. A remove curse allows for an additional saving throw, or grants advantage on a monthly saving throw. A greater restoration removes this curse immediately.


Curse Tablet
3rd-level necromancy (ritual)
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a lead tablet)
Duration: 1 week
        You inscribe your victim’s name on a lead tablet, invoke the spirits of the dead, and place the tablet in an occupied tomb.
        Each midnight thereafter, your victim must succeed at a Wisdom saving throw. Failure means the subject suffers horrifying nightmares of his own death. When the target wakes up, he will have taken a level of exhaustion that cannot be removed until he gets an undisturbed night’s rest. He will also take 1d10 psychic damage. The levels of exhaustion are cumulative. If the target succeeds on the saving throw, he is unaffected that night.
        If your target succeeds at three saving throws in a row, the curse is broken and the spell ends. If the curse tablet, which radiates both magic and evil, is found and destroyed, this also breaks the curse, but it will inflict 1d10 psychic damage to the target as well. 
        Because the curse is laid upon the tablet and not directly on the target, a remove curse spell will not end the curse. It will, however, give the target advantage on the next night’s saving throw.
        At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the spell lasts an additional two days per spell slot above 3rd level. 


Cursed Image

        ♦        Immobilization. You hold the effigy tightly. The target becomes paralyzed. The escape DC is equal to your spell save DC. 
        ♦        Wounding. You stab or pummel the effigy. The target may attempt to avoid taking damage by making a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 3d10 force damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.
        If you incorporate a bit of hair, skin, blood, nail clipping, etc., your target is at disadvantage on his attempts to escape and his saving throw.

You control the chariot’s horizontal and vertical movements mentally. You can cross rivers, chasms, and so forth, floating level with the last solid surface it touched until reaching solid ground again, at which point you can alter its altitude.
        Any nonmagical missile lighter than a boulder aimed at the chariot is blown aside. Melee attacks aimed in or out of the chariot are at disadvantage; melee attacks from one rider to another are unaffected. The chariot itself is immune to physical attack.
        The chariot can be used as a weapon by ramming it into a target. Each creature of Large size or smaller that is outside of the chariot and that touches the chariot must make a Strength saving throw at disadvantage. On a failure, the creature takes 8d10 bludgeoning damage and is flung in a random direction and knocked prone. If the target hit a solid object, such as a wall or floor, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown.

        On a hit, the whip inflicts 3d8 bludgeoning damage and wraps around the target, grappling it (escape DC is equal to your spell save DC). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and you cannot use the darkbolt on another target. In addition, at the start of each of the target’s turns, the darkbolt squeezes, causing an additional 3d8 bludgeoning damage.

Duration: 1 hour
        You cast this spell on a vial of water, and then immediately cast another spell on the vial. The second spell must be of 3rd level or lower and must have a range of Self or Touch.

Dead Man’s Eyes
6th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 round
Range: Self
Components: S, M (two eyeball-sized glass marbles the same color as your own eyes)

On a failed save, a creature suffers an effect based on its current hit points:
        ♦        50 hit points or fewer: 4d6 necrotic damage.
        ♦        30 hit points or fewer: 8d6 necrotic damage and become blinded for 1 minute.
        ♦        10 hit points or fewer: 10d10 necrotic damage and become blinded permanently.

If that creature is ever near death or contracts a fatal illness, the candle will gutter and dim, but it will only go out when that creature dies.

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (seven drops of holy or unholy water)

        You make a pact with your deity or patron to protect the life on a single target of your choice. This pact ensures that the target will survive an untimely death. You must cast this spell in an area which has been sanctified to your deity, and you must permanently sacrifice 10 hit points. 
        Should that target die due to combat, spell, or accident, the target’s remains are instantly transported back to the sanctuary where you cast this spell and the creature will be brought back to life, whole and intact—any missing limbs will be restored and all conditions and enchantments will be removed. Furthermore, all but 10 of the creature’s hit points will be restored; those hit points will be permanently lost as a sacrifice.


Death Prayer
Abjuration cantrip
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 days 
        You pray over a corpse, reducing the likelihood that it will rise as an undead.

        You may throw the vial at a target within 30 feet, using your spell attack modifier. On a hit, the vial shatters and the target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 6d6 necrotic damage and be paralyzed for 10 minutes on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage and be paralyzed for 1 minute on a successful one.

The opponent’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the amount of radiant damage taken, and you regain hit points equal to that amount.

        While this spell is active, any words you or anyone within ten feet of you magically appear on a blank piece of paper in the language in which they were spoken.

d20
	Result
	1-5
	Failure. The creature is horribly defective or mutated in some way. It may be stillborn, it might die shortly after birth, or it might survive to adulthood—in which case it will always breed true, and it may have gained unforseen abilities.
	6-9
	Failure. There is a 50% chance that it will pass on the trait to its offspring, however.
	10-18
	Success. There is a 50% chance that it will not pass the trait on to its offspring, however.
	19-20
	Complete success. The creature will always breed true.
	

        At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a 9th-level spell slot, the GM always rolls with advantage.

        You ask your god, patron, or the universe at large a question and make a DC 18 spellcasting ability check. On a success, you learn the utter truth of the matter. This cannot be a question about the future; it can only concern something that has happened or is currently happening.

Casting Time: 1 action

        You create a shadowy mastiff with glowing eyes, visible and audible only to you and the target of the spell. Upon first seeing the hound, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at disadvantage. On a success, the hound disappears. On a failure, the creature is frightened for 10 minutes.
        Thereafter, the target is relentless stalked by the hound. It never comes closer than 10 feet or farther than 300 feet from the target, but it fills the target with an unshakable premonition of death. While haunted by the hound, the target is at disadvantage on all saving throws to avoid being frightened. The hound, despite its fear-inspiring appearance, cannot attack and cannot be attacked. 
        This curse can be broken by casting a remove curse or wish spell, if the target rolls natural twenties on both dice when saving against being frightened, or if you use your action to dismiss the spell.

        When a hostile spell is aimed at you or another creature, one sphere that is within 10 feet of the target will absorb the magic. It will then wink out of existence, taking the spell energy with it. 
        The spheres do not negate hostile magic that was already in the area, nor do they absorb magic from non-hostile damaging spells (such as a wall of fire). The spheres do not negate the use of magic items, unless the item uses a charge to cast a spell—it will absorb a magic missile cast by a wand of magic missiles but will not protect someone from the necrotic damage inflicted by a sword of life stealing.

Rather, for the positive version, makes the target’s eyes appear to sparkle, their skin clearer and smoother, their teeth straighter and whiter, and their hair thicker and more lustrous; or for the negative version, makes the person seem lackluster and unkempt. An unwilling target may make a Wisdom saving throw to resist.

This does not reveal the source of the emotion or any other information about it. Only one emotion (the most prominent one the target is experiencing) per casting of the spell is revealed.
        A creature that is aware that you are or might be attempting to contact its mind may attempt to make an Intelligence saving throw to resist; otherwise, there is no saving throw.

That creature permanently has its Strength and Constitution permanently reduced by 1d4 each and takes 6d10 necrotic damage. If this brings that creature to 0 hit points, it dies and rises as a specter in 1d4 hours.
        Each time you cast this spell, you must roll 1d20. If you roll a 1, your connection to the Negative Plane is too strong and you lose the same amount of Strength, Constitution, and hit points.


Enervation

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 100 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 6 hours
        A black beam of enervating energy springs from your finger towards a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target.

If the target already has one or more levels of exhaustion, this spell cannot take him past the fifth level. If the hit point reduction takes the target to 0 hit points, it dies. This exhaustion and hit point reduction last for 6 hours or until the target takes a long rest.

        You point to one Large or smaller creature within range that is standing on natural, unworked earth, sand, rock, or a similar material (or on vegetation that is on top of such a material). A block of solid stone rises out of the ground and engulfs the target within. The target may make a Dexterity saving throw to resist. For the duration of the spell, the target is subjected to the petrified condition. If the creature has the ability to pass through solid stone and does not need to activate that ability (such as if the creature is naturally immaterial), then it cannot be affected by this spell. When the spell expires, the stone crumbles away, leaving the engulfed target unharmed.

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
        You magically remove one set of writings you can see, up to one page’s worth at a time. This automatically removes nonmagical writings. If you are attempting to remove magical writing, including spells such as glyph of warding or symbol, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, the writing is erased.
        This spell does not work on illusory writing, such as that produced by illusory script, as that writing isn’t real.


Erik’s Quills
Conjuration cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a porcupine quill)
Duration: 1 minute
        You conjure and throw 2d4 long quills, which unerringly strike one or two chosen targets within range, even getting in between the chinks in the target’s armor. Each does 1 point of piercing damage each, for each of three rounds, and remains in the wound. 
        The target may use a bonus action to yank a quill out, but that inflicts an additional 1 point of damage. Otherwise, the quills vanish in 10 minutes.
        The number of quills you create increases by 2d4 when you reach 5th level (4d4), 11th level (6d4) and 17th level (8d4)


Estate Transference
9th-level conjuration (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: Self (up to a 20-square-mile radius sphere)
Components: V, S, M (a magical item used to control elementals of the appropriate kind, which must be placed in the center of the area to be affected and remain there permanently, and a large number of bricks made of elemental matter.
Duration: Permanent.
        You mark out a large area of land by surrounding it with bricks made out of the solidified material from one of the elemental planes (placed no more than five feet apart and/or three feet underground), and in the center of that area, you place the elemental-controlling item (which must be of the same element as the bricks). Then, when you cast this spell, a sphere containing all the land, water, and air you marked is permanently transferred to that plane, leaving nothing behind but a semicircular hole in the ground.
        You create a pocket of Prime Material matter within that elemental plane. The water and air are self-renewing, and the temperature and weather conditions of your pocket are identical to the way they were when you cast this spell. 
        The heart of this spell is in the elemental-controlling item. If this item is disturbed in any way, the spell immediately fails and the energies of the elemental plane flood into the protected area.

        This spell can only create nonmagical arrows.


Evolve

Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a bit of your hair or blood, a miniature hand-tool of any kind, and a pearl worth 500 gp, which is consumed in the casting of this spell)
Duration: Instantaneous
        You touch a beast, plant, or monstrosity with an Intelligence of 1 to 5 that has no magical abilities such as innate spellcasting. That creature must then make a Constitution saving throw, with disadvantage if it is of the same “type” (such as if you are a mammal attempting to affect another mammal) as you and with advantage if it is radically different from you (such as if you are a mammal attempting to affect a crustacean or a plant). If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, the spell is negated.
        If the creature fails on its saving throw, then over the course of the next 24 hours, it slowly “evolves” into an anthropomorphic being.
        The creature’s type becomes humanoid. If the creature had four or more legs, its forelimbs become arms and hands and it walks on its hind legs. A creature with no limbs or with wings instead of forelimbs has a 50% chance of growing arms. If it doesn’t grow arms, it gains another method of manipulating objects, such as prehensile feet or tail.
        A Tiny creature becomes Small and its hit die type changes to d6. A Huge creature shrinks to Large and its hit die type becomes d10 (Gargantuan creatures cannot be affected by this spell).

        On a failure, the target’s mind is “short-circuited” and it loses a number of spells equal to your level, starting with 1st-level spells and moving on to more powerful spells. That target will not be able to cast those spells until it has had a chance to re-prepare them. 
        Targets that have innate spellcasting abilities lose the ability to cast that number of spells until it takes a short or long rest.
        This spell has no effect on non-spellcasters.

        ♦        Teleport. You choose up to 11 creatures within a 30-foot radius and teleport them to a random location within 1 mile. If the creatures are unwilling, they may make a Wisdom saving throw to resist.

        While this spell is in effect, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, resistance to paralysis and petrifaction, and are immune to exhaustion. Furthermore, you don’t bleed and you age half as quickly as normal. However, you also lose the ability to heal naturally; you can only heal through magical means.
        When this spell ends, either after a year or through other means, it instantly replaces the stone heart in your chest. If at any time your real heart is destroyed, you die instantly. Because of this, it is wise to place your heart somewhere very safe. The stone heart may be reused for this spell.

Components: V, S
Duration: 6 hours

        The hand then flies off with a speed of 60 feet, and it can pass through a crack as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing. If it finds such a creature, it will beckon for that creature to follow. If that creature follows, it will point in your direction and lead the creature in the most direct route to you. It will stay about 10 feet ahead of the creature and will pause to let it catch up, but it doesn’t understand concepts such as safety.
        If the subject decides not to follow it, the hand will return to you and hover, palm-up, to indicate failure. It will then vanish.

The creature can be awakened for a brief time but will go back to sleep once it is no longer needed. At the end of the duration, the creature will wake up very hungry and thirsty. If you are not the one in hibernation, you may use your action to dismiss the spell.

They appear to be a mix of people appropriate for the circumstances and location. When it’s appropriate, they will applaud, chit-chat, and eat available snacks. If it’s appropriate for the circumstances, they may flirt or act as bullies. They do not talk about themselves at all, as they have no history or true knowledge beyond trivia you yourself might know. Nor do they leave the area. When the spell’s duration ends, or you dismiss the spell, the audience members leave in the same way they came in.
        The members of the audience do not fight in any manner. They have an AC of 10 and 1 hp, and will instantly vanish if harmed in any manner.

        Each time the creature attempts to break that law, it must make a Charisma saving throw in order to do so.

Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S

When you finish casting the spell, each creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If either of these rolls are successful, the spell fails.
        If both creatures fail their saving throws, then over the course of the next 24 hours, the creatures begin to mutate and join together, taking on characteristics of both “parent” creatures. The GM should roll a d20.


Roll
	Result
	1-5
	Success. The resulting creature looks more or less like a combination of its two original forms.
	6
	Bonding. The creatures are not truly melded together but instead are conjoined in some way.
	7
	Imperfect Melding. The two creatures have joined together in a “tauric” fashion—half one creature and half the other.
	8
	Shapeshifter. The creature is melded but can shift between its two parent forms and may have a split personality—it does not have a “hybrid” form. The change may be voluntary or involuntary.
	9
	Dominance. The creature looks mostly like one of its original forms with only hints of the original creature.
	10
	Death. While it looks like the desired creature, something went horribly wrong with the transformation and it takes 15d10+20 necrotic damage. If it is still alive, it may be able to be nursed back to health.
	

        The resultant creature’s attributes, abilities, and attacks should be determined by the GM, using the original creatures’ attributes as a guideline.

        The target becomes frightened of the most horrific-looking thing for the duration of the spell. If that object is removed from the target’s sight for more than ten minutes, the target will become frightened of something else. The target will also become increasingly paranoid during this time.
        An ally of that target may attempt to talk the target out of the delusion, allowing that target to make one Intelligence saving throw to negate the spell.

Duration: Until dispelled
        You turn one creature or object in range that you can see into a full-color, two-dimensional image on the surface you have provided. The creature or object is reduced to 12:1 scale; it must be able to fit on the writing surface in its reduced form for the spell to work. An unwilling creature may make a Charisma saving throw to avoid the effect. 
        You decide whether the creature is to remain animate (in which case, it counts as restrained, although it still can move slowly about its canvas in a stilted manner), or if it to become a still picture. If you choose to allow it to remain animate, it can see and hear, but cannot speak, attack, or cast spells. If you choose for the creature to become a still picture, the creature is put in stasis. In both cases, the creature does not age, eat, drink, sleep, or breathe. Inanimate objects remain in the picture indefinitely.
        A trapped creature may make a new saving throw each day. On a success, this effect ends and the creature is freed. A dispel magic, remove curse, or wish spell can also end this effect.

The event is played back perfectly—you see, hear, smell, and feel the events perfectly.

        You create a web of force that wraps around the wings and body of any one flying creature within range. The creature is grappled (escape DC equal to your spell save DC) and restrained as long as the grapple remains.


Wing Gifting
4th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 100 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour
        One willing creature you touch gains a pair of wings. The creature’s flying speed is double your walking speed, and the creature gains one additional ability, depending on the type of wing:
        ♦        Butterfly Wings. These wings grant the bearer the ability to flutter—the bearer moves in an erratic fashion. While in the air, any creature targeting the bearer with a melee or missile weapon attack are at disadvantage to do so.
        ♦        Dragon Wings. These wings grant the bearer a wing buffet attack, which can be used as a bonus action. This attack has a reach of 10 feet and inflicts 1d4 + the bearer’s Strength modifier, and that creature must make a Strength saving throw, with a DC equal to 8 + the bearer’s Strength modifier, or fall prone.
        ♦        Dragonfly Wings. These wings grant the bearer the ability to hover.
        ♦        Eagle Wings. These wings grant the bearer the ability to make a dive attack. If that creature dives at least 30 feet straight towards a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack, the attack deals an additional 1d10 damage to the target.


Wolfjaws
2nd-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a wolf’s tool)
Duration: 1 minute
        You transform your hand into a pair of powerful, wolf-like jaws. You use your spell attack modifier to attack. On a hit, you inflict 2d8 + your Strength modifier in piercing damage and, if you choose, the target is grappled (escape DC equals your spell save DC). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and you can’t bite another target. At the beginning of each of your turns, you inflict an additional 1d8 piercing damage for as long as the grapple remains in effect.


Wyvern Watch
2nd-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 12 hours
        You create a cloud of mauve smoke in roughly the shape of a wyvern, which you set to guard an area. If a creature of Small size or larger approaches within 10 feet, the wyvern strikes and the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute.
        As soon as a creature has succumbed to the wyvern’s attack, or when 12 hours has passed, the wyvern will dissipate.


Year Stealing
8th-level necromancy (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: 1 mile
Components: V, S, M (the blood of the intended victim, a glass screen, and a black candle)
Duration: Permanent
        You take the blood and use it to inscribe ritualistic runes on the screen, all the while holding the lit candle. At the end of the casting, the creature’s whose blood you are using must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 6d6 necrotic damage and your age is reduced by a number of years equal to half the amount of damage inflicted. If the creature takes enough damage to kill it, it will look as though it died of old age.


Zone of Deception
2nd-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 minutes
You create a magical zone that guards against the truth in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak the truth while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.
        An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it doesn’t want to lie. Such a creature can hint at the truth as long as the bulk of its statement is a lie.
